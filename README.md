## Usage

After clicking the "Generate Password" button, you are asked a series of the following prompts:

- How many characters would you like the password length to be?
- Would you like it to contain lowercase letters?
- Would you like it to contain uppercase letters?
- Would you like it to contain numbers?
- Would you like it to contain special characters?

* _Note: not the most secure password generator! :)_

## Tests

_This password generator passes the following test cases:_

- Password length entered is < 8, > 128, or NaN -> Prompt to enter valid input
- Cancel at password length prompt -> end program
- At least one of each of the selected character types (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special characters) is contained within the password
- No character types selected -> prompts to select at least one charcter type and returns to the first character type prompt
- Generating a password again in the same session -> replaces old password with new password

## Future Enhancements

- add a "Copy Password" button to copy the password to the clipboard
